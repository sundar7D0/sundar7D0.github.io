Hello! I'm Sundar Raman P, a digital engineer at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/). Before that, I studied EE at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).
I'm fascinated by beautiful systems and love designing better systems by exploiting the synergy between it's different sub-systems. I am also interested in algorithms, optimization, hardware acceleration, and genomics. I spend much of my thinking time building up a mental model of the world. I have a soft spot for nature and sports, and I cherish the complexity arising out of simple game constructs. Please download my resume here.
