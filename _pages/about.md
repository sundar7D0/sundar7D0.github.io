Hello! I'm Sundar Raman P, a digital engineer at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/), working in Processors group. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with minors in Computing, AI/ML from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I'm fascinated by beautiful systems and love designing better systems by exploiting the synergy between it's different sub-systems. My primary research interest lies in **pushing the boundary of efficient computing systems through co-design**. I am also interested in algorithms, optimization, hardware acceleration, and genomics. I spend much of my thinking time building up a mental model of the world. I have a soft spot for nature and sports, and I cherish the complexity arising out of simple game constructs. Ping me if you want to collaborate or chat about any topic under the sun. 

Please find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T2o1uh5d44n800eBZKQYTR2xpEf9uWne/view?usp=share_link).
