excerpt: "Proposed six simple-to-code, scalable **heuristics** for **NP-hard** Maximum Scatter Travelling Salesman Problem (MSTSP). Studied the reliability of these algorithms in terms of runtime, quality, and stability using **smoothed analysis**, by slightly perturbing the inputs. Observed **practical efficacy** of simple heuristics despite their exponential worst-case complexity due to **polynomial expected runtime**, as the worst-case instances are **sparse** and **rare**. Find [code](https://github.com/sundar7D0/maximum-scatter-TSP)."

Proposed six simple-to-code, scalable **heuristics** for **NP-hard** Maximum Scatter Travelling Salesman Problem (MSTSP). Studied the reliability of these algorithms in terms of runtime, quality, and stability using **smoothed analysis**, by slightly perturbing the inputs. Observed **practical efficacy** of simple heuristics despite their exponential worst-case complexity due to **polynomial expected runtime**, as the worst-case instances are **sparse** and **rare**.
