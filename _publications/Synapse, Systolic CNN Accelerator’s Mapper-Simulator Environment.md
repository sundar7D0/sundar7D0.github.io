title: "Synapse, Systolic CNN Accelerator’s Mapper-Simulator Environment"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/synapse-mapper-simulator-for-inference-accelerator
excerpt: "Designed a python compiler that schedules instructions given network, architecture configuration and an event-driven, analytical, data-flow accurate simulator for [ShaktiMAAN](https://github.com/iitm-sysdl/SHAKTIMAAN), an open-source systolic inference accelerator effort at [RISE](https://shakti.org.in/) lab. This infrastructure helped address challenges in hardware verification, bottleneck analysis, design-space trade-offs & compiler optimization for our accelerator. Further, Deep Reinforcement Learning agents (using PPO optimization algorithm) were used along with mapper-simulator to evaluate & explore the design space (tunable hardware/software knobs) of our hardware to map DL networks ∼10% more efficiently than existing heuristics on our hardware."
