title: "Synapse, Systolic CNN Accelerator’s Mapper-Simulator Environment"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/synapse-mapper-simulator-for-inference-accelerator
excerpt: "For [ShaktiMAAN](https://github.com/iitm-sysdl/SHAKTIMAAN), an open-source **systolic inference accelerator** effort at [RISE](https://shakti.org.in/) lab, I designed a python compiler that schedules instructions given network, architecture configuration, and an event-driven, analytical, data-flow accurate simulator. This infrastructure helped address challenges in hardware verification, bottleneck analysis, design-space trade-offs, and **compiler optimization** for our accelerator. Further, **Deep Reinforcement Learning agents** (using PPO optimization algorithm) were used along with mapper-simulator to evaluate and explore the design space (tunable hardware/software knobs like buffer-size, loop-order, etc.) of our hardware to map DL networks **∼10%** more efficiently than existing heuristics on our hardware.
