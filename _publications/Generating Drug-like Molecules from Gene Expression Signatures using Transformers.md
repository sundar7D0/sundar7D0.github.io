title: "Generating Drug-like Molecules from Gene Expression Signatures using Transformers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/drug-discovery-using-transformers
excerpt: "Designed a modified **transformer** architecture to generate many **drug-like molecules** that can induce a desired transcriptomic profile based on **gene-expression** signatures. Outperformed then state-of-the-art 2-staged GAN model by ∼40% in validity, uniqueness, ∼30% in synthesizability, ∼10% in similarity metrics of generated molecules. Upon evaluating our model on unseen gene expression signatures (even disease-associated), we observed that the molecules generated by our model are not only similar to the actual compounds to a reasonable extent, but the model also learns certain structural and chemical features that are responsible for specific alterations in gene expression.
